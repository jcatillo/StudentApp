## 🚀 Getting Started

### Backend Setup
1. Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
3. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and configure your `DATABASE_URL` and other secrets.
4. Run migrations and seed the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:generate
   npm run db:migrate
   npm run seed
   ```
5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Android Setup
1. Open the project in **Android Studio**.
2. Create an `.env` file in the `app/` directory (refer to the documentation for required keys).
3. Set `API_BASE_URL` to your backend endpoint (e.g., your local machine's IP or a private production URL).
4. Build and run the app on an emulator or physical device.
